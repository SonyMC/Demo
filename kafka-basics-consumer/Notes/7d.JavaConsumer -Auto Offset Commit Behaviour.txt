Java Consumer- Auto Offset Commit Behaviour
-------------------------------------------




- In the Java Consumer API, offsets are regularly committed
- Enable at-least once reading scenario by default( undr conditions)
- Offests are committed when you call .poll() and auto.commit.interval.ms has elapsed
- E.g.: auto.commit.interval.ms=5000 and enable.auto.commit=true will commit every 5 seconds
- Make sure messages are all successfully processed before you cal lpoll() again
	- If you don;t, you will not be in at-least-once 	reading scenario
	- In that(rare) case,you must disable enable.auto.commit, and most likely most process to a separate thread, and then from time to time call .commitSync() or .commitAsync() with teh correct offsets manually( advanced) 
	  



			





- ConsumerDemoWithShutdown.java:
		- Right click -> Run ConsumerDemoCooperative.main()
		

				- From logs you can see 
					- auto.commit.interval.ms=5000
					- enable.auto.commit=true
